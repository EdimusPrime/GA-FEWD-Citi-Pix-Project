"JavaScript is powerful: we're able to take user interaction and information and use it to update the page without requiring a refresh.

This week, a new startup in your city, CitiPix, is looking to create a personalized picture app that allows users to store pictures they've taken around the world and quickly access them by typing in keywords or tags associated with each photo; they have asked for your help to start building the front-end prototype.

You will begin by building a web-app that will take a user's input and update the background image of the page based on that input. Once again, you have been given the starter code that includes the HTML and the CSS.

Use the images in the images folder and write JavaScript to make the background image reflect user input based on the Technical Requirements below.

Call $.val() on inputs to get the string value of your user's input
Store user input in var city
Use $.on(submit) or $.click to figure out when the user clicks the "submit" button
Create if / else if / else conditionals to control the flow of your application
Write at least six different lines of pseudocode and display them inline as JavaScript comments
Prevent a form submission using the event.preventDefault() function
Use the $.ready() handler to delay your code from executing until all DOM assets have been loaded
Use attr() or addClass() to affect the body class for changing the background image. Example we did in class: http://codepen.io/trnelson/pen/LNyrLb
Use the || operator in your conditionals to allow for multiple string values to execute if/else if statement code
If a user submits:

"New York" or "New York City" or "NYC" make the background of the page nyc.jpg
"San Francisco" or "SF" or "Bay Area" make the background of the page sf.jpg
"Los Angeles" or "LA" or "LAX" make the background of the page la.jpg
"Austin" or "ATX" make the background of the page austin.jpg
"Sydney" or "SYD" make the background of the page sydney.jpg
Bonus

Remove extra spaces or new lines that users or the browser might add before or after their input
Reset the user input field after it is submitted'

I added additional customization to the project when the user searches for the cities. (Title on Tab of page changes, as well as the header). I also added an additional City not part of the original project (Detroit).
