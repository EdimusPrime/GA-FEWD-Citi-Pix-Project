## Citi-Pix
### General Assembly Project
---

An earlier project provided during time with FEWD at General Assembly. Exercise in Javascript to take user interaction and information and use it to update the page without requiring a refresh.

A new startup in your city, CitiPix, is looking to create a personalized picture app that allows users to store pictures they've taken around the world and quickly access them by typing in keywords or tags associated with each photo; they have asked for your help to start building the front-end prototype. We were to build a web-app that will take a user's input and update the background image of the page based on that input

If a user submits:

* "New York" or "New York City" or "NYC" make the background of the page nyc.jpg
* "San Francisco" or "SF" or "Bay Area" make the background of the page sf.jpg
* "Los Angeles" or "LA" or "LAX" make the background of the page la.jpg
* "Austin" or "ATX" make the background of the page austin.jpg
* "Sydney" or "SYD" make the background of the page sydney.jpg

```
#### Update

As a fun bonus/challenge for myself in class, I added Detroit as an option (as it is my Hometown). 
I also added code to further tweak and change the page for each city beyond just the background that was required for the class.
